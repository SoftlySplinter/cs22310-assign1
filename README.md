# CS22310 Assignment: February 2011: Website usability mini-project

This assignment applies the web design and general usability guidelines and
principles that you learned in the lectures of the course (and in your own
reading) to two tasks:

1. The evaluation of three existing large web sites
2. The design and evaluation of your own web site

This should be written as a report and you should limit yourself to 3500 words.

The assignment is worth 50% of the marks for this course. The final report
should be submitted via SafeAssign on Blackboard between 10am and 10pm
on Wednesday **6th April 2011**. More information on the SafeAssign process
can be found here:

Please submit the report as a pdf â€“ any other format will not be marked. The
file size should be less than 10Mb.

The assignment will be assessed in line with the assessment criteria for
essays given in the student handbook. You should work on your own for this
assignment and not share any material with other students (your attention is
drawn to the plagiarism warning given in the Student Handbook). More
information on what constitutes plagiarism can be found here:

## Part 1: Applying web design guidelines to three sites

For each site that you choose, you should do the following:

* Approach the site with a specific purpose in mind (e.g. buying a certain
  item at amazon.com). Start at the site's home page and try to approach
  the site as if you had never seen it before, even if that is not the case.
* Note the decisions that you made as you try to complete the task.
* Write a narrative of what you did to accomplish the task.
* Consider how the site matches the guidelines for web design from Krug
  given in lecture 2, paying special attention to the ease of site navigation.
  Could closer attention to the guidelines have improved the site? Are
  there any improvements that could be made that are not covered by
  the guidelines?

## Part 2: Design and evaluation of your own website

Apply the usability principles that you have learned to both the design and
evaluation of your own web site. This can either be the development of your
own personal website, or the development of a fictitious business site (e.g.
e-commerce). The website should consist of at least 10 pages (not all need to
contain useful information) and should be structured logically, containing
sections and subsections. The underlying code will not be assessed. The use
of CMSs and HTML editors (such as 
[SeaMonkey](http://www.seamonkey-project.org/)) is allowed.

In the report itself, you should

* Discuss any lessons learned from the evaluation in Part 1 above that
  have affected your design decisions.
* More importantly, describe how you have approached the design of
  your site and how you have incorporated the usability principles given
  in the lectures. You should include several screenshots of the web site
  to illustrate this.
* Justify any decisions made in this process.
* Discuss any problems encountered in the design and how they have
  been resolved. For example, where design principles have had to be
  sacrificed to achieve functionality.
* Discuss how you have considered accessibility principles/guidelines in
  the construction of your website.
* **Important: Provide a URL in the report that points to the web
  site's location.** Don't forget to do this!

Please post any queries regarding the assignment to the assignment forum in
the discussion board on Blackboard.
